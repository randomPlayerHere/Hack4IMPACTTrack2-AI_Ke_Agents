Net Ninja is a full-stack **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** that uses a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to classify network traffic flows as either **BENIGN** or **ATTACK** in real time. You upload a CSV of network traffic logs, and it gives you back a risk assessment, attack rate, confidence scores, and a detailed breakdown — all through a dark-mode web dashboard.

It was built using the [CICIDS-2017](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html) dataset and trained on over 2 million labelled network flows.

## ✨ Features

- **Upload & Analyze** — Drop a CSV of network flows and get results in seconds
- **DCNN Model** — A 1D convolutional neural network with batch normalization and dropout, quantized to TFLite for fast inference
- **Risk Assessment** — The backend computes a risk level (MINIMAL → CRITICAL) based on the percentage of malicious flows detected
- **Visual Dashboard** — Attack vs. Benign bar chart, confidence score histogram, and a detailed per-flow results table
- **Sample Dataset** — Hit "Try Sample Dataset" to run the model instantly without needing your own data
- **CSV Export** — Download your results as a clean CSV for further analysis
- **REST API** — Fully documented FastAPI backend with a `/health` endpoint and `/predict` for integrations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python **3.10 or higher**
- A working internet connection (for CDN-loaded frontend assets like TailwindCSS)

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/randomPlayerHere/Hack4IMPACTTrack2-AI_Ke_Agents.git
cd Hack4IMPACTTrack2-AI_Ke_Agents
```

### 2. Set up a virtual environment

**Option A — using `pip` (standard)**

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate       # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Option B — using `conda`**

```bash
conda create -n nids python=3.10
conda activate nids
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Option C — using `uv` (fastest)**

```bash
pip install uv
uv sync
```

### 3. Add your models

The trained model files are too large for Git. Place them in the `models/` directory:

```
models/
├── nids_dcnn_model.tflite   ← Required (or the .h5 fallback)
├── nids_dcnn_model.h5       ← Optional fallback if no .tflite
└── cicids_scaler.pkl        ← Required
```

> If you don't have the model files, contact the project maintainers or retrain using the preprocessing notebook in `src/`.

### 4. (Optional) Set up environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env if you want to change the default host/port
```

### 5. Run the server

```bash
python app.py
```

The app will be available at **[http://localhost:8008](http://localhost:8008)**.

---

## 🖥️ Using the App

1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8008`
2. **Upload a CSV** of network traffic logs, or click **"Try Sample Dataset"** to use the included demo file
3. Wait a few seconds while the model runs inference
4. You'll be redirected to the **Results Dashboard** showing:
   - Risk level (MINIMAL / LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL)
   - Total flows analyzed, attack rate, and average model confidence
   - Attack vs. Benign bar chart and confidence histogram
   - A per-flow details table (first 30 rows)
5. Hit **"Download Results as CSV"** to export the full prediction output

## 🔌 API Reference

All endpoints are served by the FastAPI backend. You can access the auto-generated docs at `http://localhost:8008/docs`.

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/` | Serves the upload page |
| `GET` | `/results` | Serves the results dashboard |
| `GET` | `/health` | Returns model status and feature count |
| `GET` | `/sample-dataset` | Returns `test.csv` as a downloadable file |
| `POST` | `/predict` | Accepts a `.csv` file, returns JSON predictions |

### `/predict` — Example

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8008/predict \
  -F "file=@your_traffic.csv"
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "total_flows": 500,
  "n_benign": 430,
  "n_attack": 70,
  "attack_pct": 14.0,
  "avg_confidence": 97.3,
  "risk_level": "MEDIUM",
  "risk_message": "Moderate attack activity detected.",
  "results": [ ... ]
}
```

> **Note:** The API accepts CSVs with up to **10,000 rows** per request. The input schema must match the CICIDS-2017 feature set (78 features after dropping metadata columns).

## 🧠 Model Details

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Architecture | 1D Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) |
| Dataset | CICIDS-2017 (Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity) |
| Classes | BENIGN, ATTACK |
| Input | 78 normalized network flow features |
| Inference Format | TFLite (quantized) with Keras H5 fallback |
| Preprocessing | StandardScaler (fitted on training data) |

The model treats each network flow as a 1D "signal" and learns spatial patterns across feature dimensions using stacked Conv1D layers, followed by dense layers for classification.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- **Max 10,000 rows per request** — larger files will be rejected. Split them up if needed.
- **CICIDS-2017 schema only** — the model was trained on a specific set of 78 features. CSVs with a different column schema will fail at the feature validation step.
- **TFLite inference is row-by-row** — for very large batches, the Keras H5 model will be faster if you have it available.
- **No authentication** — this is a demo/hackathon tool. Don't expose it publicly without adding auth.
